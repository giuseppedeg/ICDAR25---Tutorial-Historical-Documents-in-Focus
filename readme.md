# ICDAR 2025 - Tutorial
## Historical Documents in Focus - Visual and Computational Analysis from Papyri to Inscriptions

In this brief tutorial, we will attempt to train a detection & recognition network to identify ancient Greek characters written on papyrus.

### Environment Setup

The first thing to do is to set up the Python environment to run the notebook smoothly.

If you're using `conda`, you can initialize your environment with the command:

`conda create --name environment.yml`

After executing this, an environment named `icdar_tutorial_hist` will be installed.

If you prefer to install the dependencies using pip, you can use the command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### The Tutorial

At this point, you can open the file

`tutorial.ipynb`

and begin the tutorial.
